= Apple Pay Support =

WooCommerce CirclePay includes [Apple Pay](https://woocommerce.com/apple-pay) support, which means customers can pay using payment details associated with their Apple ID. Checkout is now just an authorization (Touch ID or Face ID) away on both mobile and desktop. Only supports simple, variable, and Subscription products for now. More support to come.

= Web Payments API Support =

WooCommerce CirclePay includes [Web Payments API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/) support, which means customers can pay using payment details associated to their mobile devices, in browsers supporting the Web Payments API (Chrome for Android, amongst others). Checkout is now just a few taps away on mobile. Only supports simple, variable, and Subscription products for now. More support to come.

== Installation ==

You can download an [older version of this gateway for older versions of WooCommerce from here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/circlepay/developers/).

Please note, v4 of this gateway requires WooCommerce 3.0 and above.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the WooCommerce CirclePay plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Circlepay” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now", then "Activate".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this support recurring payments, like for subscriptions? =

Yes!

= Does this require an SSL certificate? =

Yes! In Live Mode, an SSL certificate must be installed on your site to use CirclePay. In addition to SSL encryption, CirclePay builds the security on top of the payment gateways secure channels to secure payment information.

= Does this support both production mode and sandbox mode for testing? =

Yes, it does - production and Test (sandbox) mode is driven by the API keys you use with a checkbox in the admin settings to toggle between both.

= Where can I find documentation? =

For help setting up and configuring, please refer to our [documentation](https://woocommerce.com/document/circlepay/).

= Where can I get support or talk to other users? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the Plugin Forum.
